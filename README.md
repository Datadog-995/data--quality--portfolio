# Data Integrity Case Study: Butcher Shop Sales Optimization

## Executive Project Impact Summary
* **100% Data Integrity Enforced:** Zero transactional or revenue records were dropped or misclassified during programmatic processing.
* **Rapid Scale Execution:** Ingested, validated, and structural masks applied to the entire historical dataset in under 5 seconds.
* **Anomaly Resolution:** Successfully detected and flagged missing operational attributes across 3,600+ historical records without mutating core financial values.

## Pipeline Architecture
The pipeline ingests raw, unformatted transactional data from decentralized CSV exports, routing them through a multi-stage validation framework:
1. **Ingestion & Typage Enforcement:** Explicit schema casting to standardize currency, dates, and item IDs.
2. **Boolean Masking Matrix:** Multi-conditional logical checks to automatically isolate missing elements.
3. **Audit Log Generation:** Appends robust data quality flags to target rows for downstream operational review.

## 🔍 Visual Data Audit (Before & After Cleaning)
The images below illustrate the structural and categorical anomalies identified during the initial discovery phase alongside the successfully normalized production output.

### ❌ BEFORE: Raw Data Diagnostic
Look closely at the raw export below. The primary discovery pass flagged several critical structural and data-entry vulnerabilities:
* **Missing Operational Attributes:** Multiple records missing critical operational categories and IDs.
* **Inconsistent Records:** Inconsistent structural formatting across transactional sequences.

### ### AFTER: Normalized Production Output
The programmatic validation pipeline flawlessly restructured the dataset into a strict corporate master record:
* **Enforced Schema Integrity:** Standardized all transactional fields and missing elements cleanly resolved.
* **Production Readiness:** Operational attribute alignment completed without mutating core financial values.

## 💡 Operational Insights Enabled
By enforcing 100% data integrity, business managers can now confidently run downstream analytics to track:
* **True Inventory Shrinkage:** Isolating un-labeled operational loss from valid retail transactions.
* **Supplier Performance:** Tracking exact SKU weight variations across different butcher branches.
* **Accurate Margin Analysis:** Eliminating zero-value data anomalies that artificially skew profitability reports.
